# TCMPP Official mini program demo

English | [日本語](README.ja.md)

Tencent Cloud mini program platform, derived from Tencent mini program technology framework, fully follows the development specifications and standards of wechat mini program. It can not only help enterprises to put small programs into their own apps, but also provide enterprises with closed-loop ability to build their own small program ecology.

## IDE Download

You can download the Windows IDE (TCSAS Devtools) from the GitHub Releases page:

➡️ https://github.com/yuejiangli/mini-programs/releases

We do NOT commit the `.exe` into the repository to avoid bloating the git history. Each release may include:
* `TCSAS-Devtools_x64_<version>.exe`
* `TCSAS-Devtools_x64_<version>.exe.sha256` (checksum for integrity verification)

Verify after download (optional):
```
sha256sum TCSAS-Devtools_x64_<version>.exe
```
Compare the output with the contents of the corresponding `.sha256` file.
